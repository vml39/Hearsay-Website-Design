    <h1>The Audition Process</h1>

    <h1>1. Vocal Exercises</h1>

    <p>We’ll start off by asking you to sing a couple of scales and take you
    through a chord matching exercise to help us determine your range.</p>

    <h1>2. Solo</h1>

    <p>Next, we will ask you to perform a short solo, just a verse and chorus
    of a song of your choice. It’s helpful to choose a song we will be familiar
    with and one that fits comfortably in your range.</p>

    <h1>3. Callbacks</h1>

    <p>Later that week, we will hold callbacks- the second round of our audition
    process. Here, you will be able to interact with the whole group and
    participate in lots of fun activities so we have the chance to get to know
    you and you can get to know us! Next, you will learn a portion of one of
    our songs based on your voice part. You will also be asked to sing a second
    solo, preferably a different genre from your first to showcase your range.
    It’s a lot of fun, so relax!</p>

    <p>Don’t be nervous! The audition process is easy to follow and will be over
    before you know it. Best of luck to you!</p>
